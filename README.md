# Fibonacci Series Generator
## Description
This is a simple C program that generates the Fibonacci series up to a user-defined number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
## How to Compile and Run the Program
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuskanGupta1903/C.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd C
```
3. Compile the C program using GCC:
```bash
gcc -o fibonacci practice.c
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
./fibonacci
```
5. Enter the number of terms when prompted, and view the output Fibonacci series.
## Example Output
```
Enter the number of terms: 7
Fibonacci Series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```
## Future Improvements
- Implement input validation for incorrect values.
- Optimize the code using recursion or memoization.
- Store and display the series using an array.
